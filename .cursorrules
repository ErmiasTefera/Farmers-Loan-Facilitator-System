# Farmers Loan Facilitator System - Project Intelligence

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive multi-role platform for facilitating loans to Ethiopian farmers. The system supports four distinct user types with different interfaces and workflows.

## Key User Roles
1. **Farmers** - Access via USSD (*789#) and mobile web interface
2. **Data Collectors** - Field agents who register and verify farmer data
3. **Financial Institutions** - Loan officers who review applications and manage portfolios
4. **System Administrators** - Manage users and system configuration

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Routing**: TanStack Router (type-safe, file-based)
- **State Management**: Zustand + TanStack Query
- **UI**: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
- **Internationalization**: i18next (English, Amharic, Afaan Oromoo)

## Architecture Patterns

### Feature-Based Organization
- Each feature is self-contained in `src/features/`
- Features include: components/, layouts/, pages/, api.ts, routes.ts
- Shared functionality goes in `src/core/`
- Use `@features/` and `@core/` path aliases

### Authentication Pattern
- Role-based access control with JWT tokens
- Different login flows per user role
- Protected routes based on user roles
- Store authentication state in Zustand

### Routing Pattern
- Use TanStack Router with nested routes
- Feature routes are functions that return route configurations
- Implement route protection with `beforeLoad`
- Use layouts to wrap feature pages

### Component Patterns
- Use Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Implement controlled forms with validation
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow mobile-first responsive design

## Development Preferences

### File Naming
- Use kebab-case for file names: `login-form.tsx`
- Use PascalCase for component names: `LoginForm`
- Use camelCase for functions and variables
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

### Code Organization
- Group related functionality in feature folders
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Implement proper error handling and loading states

### State Management
- Use Zustand for global state (auth, UI, feature-specific)
- Use React useState for local component state
- Use TanStack Query for server state
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate

### API Patterns
- Create feature-specific API modules
- Use centralized API client with axios
- Implement consistent error handling
- Use TypeScript for API response types

## User Experience Guidelines

### Multi-Language Support
- Support English, Amharic, and Afaan Oromoo
- Use i18next namespaces for feature organization
- Implement language switching functionality
- Consider right-to-left text support

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- Support USSD, mobile web, tablet, and desktop
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Optimize for slow internet connections

### Offline Capabilities
- Implement service worker for offline support
- Use IndexedDB for local data storage
- Implement conflict resolution for offline changes
- Provide clear offline/online status indicators

## Critical Implementation Paths

### 1. User Role System
- Extend AppUser interface to support multiple roles
- Implement role-based authentication flows
- Create role-specific layouts and navigation
- Add route protection based on user roles

### 2. USSD Interface
- Create interactive USSD simulator
- Implement menu navigation and user input
- Handle session management and state
- Support basic mobile phones without internet

### 3. Offline Sync
- Implement service worker for offline functionality
- Use IndexedDB for local data storage
- Create sync queue for offline changes
- Handle conflict resolution and data merging

### 4. Multi-Platform Support
- Ensure responsive design works on all devices
- Optimize for different screen sizes and input methods
- Implement touch-friendly interfaces for mobile
- Support both portrait and landscape orientations

## Known Challenges

### 1. Complex User Journeys
- Each user role has very different workflows
- Need to support both simple (USSD) and complex (web) interfaces
- Must handle users with varying technical literacy

### 2. Offline-First Architecture
- Data collectors work in areas with poor connectivity
- Need sophisticated offline sync capabilities
- Must handle data conflicts and synchronization

### 3. Multi-Language Complexity
- Support for three languages with different scripts
- Need to handle right-to-left text
- Must consider cultural differences in UI design

### 4. Security and Privacy
- Handle sensitive financial and personal data
- Implement secure offline data storage
- Ensure data protection compliance

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development
1. Create feature folder structure
2. Define TypeScript interfaces
3. Implement API layer
4. Create UI components
5. Add routing and navigation
6. Implement state management
7. Add internationalization
8. Test across different devices

### Code Quality
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint rules for code consistency
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for better UX
- Write accessible components

### Testing Strategy
- Test on multiple devices and screen sizes
- Verify offline functionality
- Test multi-language support
- Validate accessibility compliance
- Test with different user roles

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Optimization
- Use code splitting for feature-based loading
- Implement lazy loading for routes
- Optimize images and assets
- Minimize bundle size for mobile users

### Caching Strategy
- Cache API responses with TanStack Query
- Implement service worker caching
- Use localStorage for user preferences
- Cache static assets for offline access

### Mobile Optimization
- Minimize network requests
- Optimize for slow connections
- Implement progressive loading
- Use efficient data structures

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication
- Implement secure JWT token handling
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement proper session management
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data in storage
- Implement secure offline data handling
- Use secure communication protocols
- Follow data protection regulations

## Deployment Considerations

### Progressive Web App
- Implement service worker for offline support
- Add app manifest for mobile installation
- Optimize for mobile performance
- Ensure fast loading times

### Multi-Environment Support
- Support development, staging, and production
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper error monitoring
- Add analytics and performance tracking
