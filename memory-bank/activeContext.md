# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project has successfully implemented a comprehensive **multi-role Farmers Loan Facilitator System** with advanced features including offline capabilities, user impersonation, and proper loan-payment relationships. The system is now ready to move to the **Financial Institution Workspace** implementation.

## Recent Major Achievements

### âœ… Loan Relationship System Fix
- **Database Schema Enhancement**: Added proper relationships between `loan_applications`, `loans`, and `payments`
- **Progress Calculation Fix**: Resolved NaN issues in loan progress by calculating remaining amount from actual payments
- **Payment Linking**: Payments now properly link to both loan applications and loans
- **Automatic Triggers**: Database triggers automatically create loans when applications are approved
- **Type Safety**: Updated TypeScript types to support new relationships

### âœ… User Impersonation System
- **Comprehensive Impersonation**: Complete system for testing different user roles
- **Role-Based User Loading**: Dynamically loads users based on selected role
- **State Persistence**: Impersonation state persists across sessions
- **Page Refresh Integration**: Automatic page refresh when switching impersonated users
- **API Integration**: All API calls use effective user context (impersonated or actual)

### âœ… Role Switching with Auto-Selection
- **Smart Role Switching**: Automatically selects first user when switching roles
- **Impersonation Reset**: Clears impersonation when changing roles
- **Seamless Navigation**: Smooth transitions between different role contexts
- **Clean State Management**: Each role starts with fresh, clean state
