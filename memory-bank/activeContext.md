# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is transitioning from a basic authentication system to a comprehensive **multi-role Farmers Loan Facilitator System**. The current implementation has foundational elements in place, but needs significant expansion to support the full feature set described in the project brief.

## Recent Changes

### âœ… Completed Foundation
- Basic authentication system (login, signup, forgot password)
- Multi-language support setup (English, Amharic, Afaan Oromoo)
- Feature-based routing architecture with TanStack Router
- UI component library with Radix UI components
- State management with Zustand
- Responsive design foundation with Tailwind CSS

### ðŸ”„ Current State
- Authentication system is functional but limited to basic user roles
- Routing structure supports feature-based organization
- UI components are ready for expansion
- Internationalization framework is in place

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: User Role System Enhancement
1. **Extend User Types and Roles**
   - Update `AppUser` interface to support multiple roles (farmer, data-collector, loan-officer, admin)
   - Enhance authentication store to handle role-based access
   - Create role-specific navigation and layouts

2. **Role-Based Route Protection**
   - Implement route guards based on user roles
   - Create role-specific redirects and access control
   - Add unauthorized access handling

### Phase 2: Core Features Implementation
3. **Farmer Features**
   - USSD simulator interface (*789#)
   - Mobile-friendly farmer dashboard
   - Loan application and status tracking
   - Payment and repayment management

4. **Data Collector Workspace**
   - Dashboard for managing assigned farmers
   - Multi-step farmer registration form
   - Offline data collection and sync
   - Data verification workflow

5. **Financial Institution Workspace**
   - Loan officer dashboard with portfolio metrics
   - Loan application review interface
   - AI-powered recommendations system
   - Comprehensive reporting and analytics

6. **System Administrator Workspace**
   - User management interface
   - Role and permission management
   - System configuration and monitoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
7. **Offline Capabilities**
   - Service worker implementation
   - Offline data storage and sync
   - Conflict resolution for offline changes

8. **Real-time Features**
   - WebSocket integration for notifications
   - Live updates for loan status changes
   - Real-time collaboration features

9. **AI and Analytics**
   - Risk assessment algorithms
   - Predictive analytics for loan defaults
   - Performance dashboards and insights

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. User Role Architecture
**Decision Needed**: How to structure the user role system
- **Option A**: Single user table with role field
- **Option B**: Separate user types with inheritance
- **Option C**: Role-based permissions with flexible assignment

**Consideration**: Need to support farmers who may not have email addresses or traditional login credentials.

### 2. USSD Interface Implementation
**Decision Needed**: How to implement the USSD simulator
- **Option A**: Pure frontend simulation with mock responses
- **Option B**: Integration with actual USSD gateway
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach with simulation + real gateway

**Consideration**: USSD interface needs to work on basic mobile phones without internet.

### 3. Offline Sync Strategy
**Decision Needed**: Offline data synchronization approach
- **Option A**: IndexedDB for local storage with conflict resolution
- **Option B**: Service worker with background sync
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach with both local storage and service worker

**Consideration**: Data collectors need to work in areas with poor connectivity.

### 4. Multi-language Implementation
**Decision Needed**: Language switching and persistence
- **Option A**: URL-based language switching (/en/, /am/, /om/)
- **Option B**: User preference stored in localStorage
- **Option C**: Server-side language detection

**Consideration**: Need to support right-to-left text for some languages.

## Current Challenges

### 1. Complex User Journey Mapping
The system needs to support multiple user types with very different workflows:
- Farmers: Simple USSD/mobile interface
- Data Collectors: Complex form-based data entry
- Loan Officers: Data analysis and decision-making
- Admins: System configuration and user management

### 2. Offline-First Architecture
Data collectors need to work in areas with unreliable internet connectivity, requiring sophisticated offline sync capabilities.

### 3. Multi-Platform Support
The system needs to work across:
- Basic mobile phones (USSD)
- Smartphones (mobile web)
- Tablets (responsive web)
- Desktop computers (full web interface)

### 4. Data Security and Privacy
Handling sensitive financial and personal data requires robust security measures, especially for offline data storage.

## Immediate Next Actions

1. **Update User Types and Authentication**
   - Extend the `AppUser` interface to support multiple roles
   - Update authentication store to handle role-based access
   - Create role-specific navigation components

2. **Implement Role-Based Routing**
   - Add route protection based on user roles
   - Create role-specific layouts and navigation
   - Handle unauthorized access scenarios

3. **Create Feature Structure**
   - Set up feature folders for each user role
   - Implement basic routing for each workspace
   - Create placeholder components for major features

4. **Enhance Internationalization**
   - Add translations for all user roles
   - Implement language switching functionality
   - Test with different language content

## Success Criteria for Current Phase

- [ ] User role system supports all four user types
- [ ] Role-based routing and access control is implemented
- [ ] Basic layouts for each workspace are created
- [ ] Multi-language support works across all features
- [ ] Authentication flow supports role-based redirects
