# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is transitioning from a basic authentication system to a comprehensive **multi-role Farmers Loan Facilitator System**. The current implementation has foundational elements in place, but needs significant expansion to support the full feature set described in the project brief.

## Recent Changes

### âœ… Completed Foundation
- Basic authentication system (login, signup, forgot password)
- Multi-language support setup (English, Amharic, Afaan Oromoo)
- Feature-based routing architecture with TanStack Router
- UI component library with Radix UI components
- State management with Zustand
- Responsive design foundation with Tailwind CSS

### âœ… Supabase Integration Complete
- **Decision Made**: Use Supabase for authentication and database
- **Benefits**: Built-in auth, real-time subscriptions, Row Level Security
- **Status**: âœ… Successfully implemented and tested
- **Impact**: Replaced mock APIs with real Supabase integration

### ðŸ”„ Current State
- Authentication system is functional but limited to basic user roles
- Routing structure supports feature-based organization
- UI components are ready for expansion
- Internationalization framework is in place

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: User Role System Enhancement âœ…
1. **âœ… Supabase Setup and Configuration**
   - âœ… Set up Supabase project and environment variables
   - âœ… Create database schema for users, farmers, loans, etc.
   - âœ… Implement Supabase client configuration
   - âœ… Replace mock authentication with Supabase auth

2. **Extend User Types and Roles**
   - âœ… Update `AppUser` interface to support multiple roles (farmer, data-collector, loan-officer, admin)
   - âœ… Enhance authentication store to work with Supabase sessions
   - Create role-specific navigation and layouts
   - âœ… Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies

3. **Role-Based Route Protection**
   - Implement route guards based on user roles
   - Create role-specific redirects and access control
   - Add unauthorized access handling
   - âœ… Integrate Supabase session management

### Phase 2: Core Features Implementation
3. **âœ… Farmer Features**
   - âœ… USSD simulator interface (*789#)
   - âœ… Mobile-friendly farmer dashboard
   - âœ… Loan application and status tracking
   - âœ… Payment and repayment management
   - âœ… Supabase integration for USSD requests
   - âœ… Real-time data persistence

4. **Data Collector Workspace**
   - Dashboard for managing assigned farmers
   - Multi-step farmer registration form
   - Offline data collection and sync
   - Data verification workflow

5. **Financial Institution Workspace**
   - Loan officer dashboard with portfolio metrics
   - Loan application review interface
   - AI-powered recommendations system
   - Comprehensive reporting and analytics

6. **System Administrator Workspace**
   - User management interface
   - Role and permission management
   - System configuration and monitoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
7. **Offline Capabilities**
   - Service worker implementation
   - Offline data storage and sync
   - Conflict resolution for offline changes

8. **Real-time Features**
   - Supabase real-time subscriptions for notifications
   - Live updates for loan status changes
   - Real-time collaboration features
   - Database change notifications

9. **AI and Analytics**
   - Risk assessment algorithms
   - Predictive analytics for loan defaults
   - Performance dashboards and insights

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. User Role Architecture
**Decision Needed**: How to structure the user role system
- **Option A**: Single user table with role field
- **Option B**: Separate user types with inheritance
- **Option C**: Role-based permissions with flexible assignment

**Consideration**: Need to support farmers who may not have email addresses or traditional login credentials.

### 2. USSD Interface Implementation
**Decision Needed**: How to implement the USSD simulator
- **Option A**: Pure frontend simulation with mock responses
- **Option B**: Integration with actual USSD gateway
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach with simulation + real gateway

**Consideration**: USSD interface needs to work on basic mobile phones without internet.

### 3. Offline Sync Strategy
**Decision Needed**: Offline data synchronization approach
- **Option A**: IndexedDB for local storage with conflict resolution
- **Option B**: Service worker with background sync
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach with both local storage and service worker

**Consideration**: Data collectors need to work in areas with poor connectivity.

### 4. Multi-language Implementation
**Decision Needed**: Language switching and persistence
- **Option A**: URL-based language switching (/en/, /am/, /om/)
- **Option B**: User preference stored in localStorage
- **Option C**: Server-side language detection

**Consideration**: Need to support right-to-left text for some languages.

## Current Challenges

### 1. Complex User Journey Mapping
The system needs to support multiple user types with very different workflows:
- Farmers: Simple USSD/mobile interface
- Data Collectors: Complex form-based data entry
- Loan Officers: Data analysis and decision-making
- Admins: System configuration and user management

### 2. Offline-First Architecture
Data collectors need to work in areas with unreliable internet connectivity, requiring sophisticated offline sync capabilities.

### 3. Multi-Platform Support
The system needs to work across:
- Basic mobile phones (USSD)
- Smartphones (mobile web)
- Tablets (responsive web)
- Desktop computers (full web interface)

### 4. Data Security and Privacy
Handling sensitive financial and personal data requires robust security measures, especially for offline data storage.

## Immediate Next Actions
