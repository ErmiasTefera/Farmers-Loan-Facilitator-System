## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. User Role Architecture
**Decision Needed**: How to structure the user role system
- **Option A**: Single user table with role field
- **Option B**: Separate user types with inheritance
- **Option C**: Role-based permissions with flexible assignment

**Consideration**: Need to support farmers who may not have email addresses or traditional login credentials.

### 2. USSD Interface Implementation
**Decision Needed**: How to implement the USSD simulator
- **Option A**: Pure frontend simulation with mock responses
- **Option B**: Integration with actual USSD gateway
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach with simulation + real gateway

**Consideration**: USSD interface needs to work on basic mobile phones without internet.

### 3. âœ… Offline Sync Strategy
**Decision Made**: IndexedDB with Dexie.js for offline storage and sync
- **âœ… Implemented**: IndexedDB for local storage with conflict resolution
- **âœ… Implemented**: Sync queue management with retry logic
- **âœ… Implemented**: Offline status indicators and manual controls
- **âœ… Implemented**: Automatic fallback between online/offline modes

**Status**: âœ… Successfully implemented and tested
**Impact**: Data collectors can now work in areas with poor connectivity

### 4. Multi-language Implementation
**Decision Needed**: Language switching and persistence
- **Option A**: URL-based language switching (/en/, /am/, /om/)
- **Option B**: User preference stored in localStorage
- **Option C**: Server-side language detection

**Consideration**: Need to support right-to-left text for some languages.

## Current Challenges

### 1. Complex User Journey Mapping
The system needs to support multiple user types with very different workflows:
- Farmers: Simple USSD/mobile interface
- Data Collectors: Complex form-based data entry
- Loan Officers: Data analysis and decision-making
- Admins: System configuration and user management

### 2. âœ… Offline-First Architecture
Data collectors can now work in areas with unreliable internet connectivity through:
- **âœ… Offline Storage**: IndexedDB with Dexie.js for local data persistence
- **âœ… Sync Queue**: Automatic queuing of offline operations
- **âœ… Conflict Resolution**: Smart handling of data conflicts during sync
- **âœ… Status Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for offline/online status
- **âœ… Manual Controls**: Toggle offline mode and manual sync options

### 3. Multi-Platform Support
The system needs to work across:
- Basic mobile phones (USSD)
- Smartphones (mobile web)
- Tablets (responsive web)
- Desktop computers (full web interface)

### 4. Data Security and Privacy
Handling sensitive financial and personal data requires robust security measures, especially for offline data storage.
